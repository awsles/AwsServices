  AWS IoT Things Graph                                     iotthingsgraph:CreateFlowTemplate                                                Write                   Creates a workflow template. Workflows can be created only in the user's namespace. (The public namespace contains only entities.) The workflow can contain only entities in the specified namespace. The workflow is validated against the entities in the latest version of the user's namespace unless another namespace version is specified in the request
  AWS IoT Things Graph                                     iotthingsgraph:CreateSystemInstance                                              Write                   Creates an instance of a system with specified configurations and Things

Any new system or system instance that contains this workflow will fail to update or deploy. Existing system instances that contain the workflow will continue to run (since they use a snapshot of the workflow taken at the time of deploying the system instance)
  AWS IoT Things Graph                                     iotthingsgraph:DeleteNamespace                                                   Write                   Deletes the specified namespace. This action deletes all of the entities in the namespace. Delete the systems and flows in the namespace before performing this action
  AWS IoT Things Graph                                     iotthingsgraph:DeleteSystemInstance                                              Write                   Deletes a system instance. Only instances that have never been deployed, or that have been undeployed from the target can be deleted. Users can create a new system instance that has the same ID as a deleted system instance
  AWS IoT Things Graph                                     iotthingsgraph:DeleteSystemTemplate                                              Write                   Deletes a system. New system instances can't contain the system after its deletion. Existing system instances that contain the system will continue to work because they use a snapshot of the system that is taken when it is deployed
  AWS IoT Things Graph                                     iotthingsgraph:DeploySystemInstance                                              Write                   Deploys the system instance to the target specified in CreateSystemInstance

Only the last 100 revisions are stored. If the workflow has been deprecated, this action will return revisions that occurred before the deprecation. This action won't work for workflows that have been deleted

Only the previous 100 revisions are stored. If the system has been deprecated, this action will return the revisions that occurred before its deprecation. This action won't work with systems that have been deleted
